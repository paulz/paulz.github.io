TDD on iOS is hard, but could be successful

Here is the video from [AltConf 2015](http://altconf.com) presentation we made with Glen Tregoning

[Successful Test-Driven Development on iOS](https://realm.io/news/altconf-glen-tregoning-paul-zabelin-successful-test-driven-development-on-ios/)

Test Driven Development on iOS has presented some challenges due to lack of tools and support from Apple. This talks is how to achieve TDD and BDD on iOS: 

 - continuous integration Jenkins, Xcode bots
 - break down and parallelize builds
 - setup simulator with preset state
 - Facebook, Permissions 
 - Unit Spec, App Specs, Acceptance Tests
 - Fakes, Mocks
 - Stub network calls for tests
 - Test data modeling
 - Running backend locally for tests
 - Image comparison to assert on expected look
 - Recommending tooling to help overcome the challenges of Apple's limited support
 - Kiwi
 - KIF
 - KIF-Kiwi
 - xctool
 - Swift
 - Swift to ObjC bridging
